How DevTinder Works (Concept Overview)
Itâ€™s like Tinder but for developers. The idea is that developers create profiles, showcasing their:
âœ… Tech stack (React, Node.js, Python, etc.)
âœ… GitHub/Portfolio links
âœ… Work experience
âœ… Interests (Open-source, Startups, Web3, AI, etc.)
âœ… Fun bio (because humor matters! ðŸ˜†)

Core Features to Build
Authentication â€“ Email, GitHub, or Google login.
Profile Creation â€“ Users add their skills, bio, and projects.
Swipe Mechanism â€“ Like/Dislike profiles based on interests.
Matching System â€“ If both like each other, it's a match!
Messaging System â€“ Chat feature to connect.
Filtering/Search â€“ Find devs based on language, location, or project type.
Premium Features (Optional) â€“ Boost profile, Super Likes, etc.
